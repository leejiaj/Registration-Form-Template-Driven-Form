# AngularForms

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

This project creates a Registration Form using Angular 6 (Template-driven form). Reference: https://angular.io/guide/forms. 

Through this project, learned how to:
Build an Angular form with a component and template.
Use ngModel to create two-way data bindings for reading and writing input-control values.
Track state changes and the validity of form controls.
Provide visual feedback using special CSS classes that track the state of the controls.
Display validation errors to users and enable/disable form controls.
Share information across HTML elements using template reference variables.
